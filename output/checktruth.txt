CLEAN RESULT: Summary. In Part I, we consider the analysis of discrete time signals. In Chapter [NUMERIC], we consider how discretizing a signal affects the signals Fourier transform. We derive the Nyquist sampling theorem, and we give conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a continuous time signal from its samples.
