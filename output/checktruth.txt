CLEAN RESULT: Summary. In Part I, we consider the analysis of discrete time signals. In Chapter [FORMULA] we consider how [FORMULA] a signal affects the signals Fourier transform. We derive the [FORMULA] sampling theorem, and we give conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a continuous time signal from its samples.
GROUND TRUTH: Summary. In Part I, we consider the analysis of discrete-time signals. In Chapter [FORMULA], we consider how discretizing a signal affects the signal’s Fourier transform. We derive the Nyquist sampling theorem, and we give conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a continuous-time signal from its samples.
