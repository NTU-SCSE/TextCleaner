Summary. In Part I, we consider the analysis of discrete-time signals. In Chapter 1, we consider how discretizing a signal affects the signal’s Fourier transform. We derive the Nyquist sampling theorem, and we give conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a continuous-time signal from its samples.

1.1 The Sample-and-hold Operation
Given a function g(t), if one samples the function when t = nTs and one holds the sampled value until the next sample comes, then the result of the sampling procedure is the function g˜(t) defined by
Y (f ) = F(y(t))(f ) ≡ e−2πjfty(t) dt.
It is easy enough to calculate the Fourier transform of h(t)—the frequency response of the filter—it is simply
(See Exercise 2.)
let us consider Δ(t) to be a periodic function. Then its Fourier series is [7]
Rewriting (1.1) and making use of the properties of the geometric series, we find that for t /= m/Fs,
= e−2πjN t \ e2πjnFst
1 − e2πjFst
When t = m/Fs, it is easy to see that hN (t) = 2N + 1. 
Because hN (t) is a combination of functions that are periodic with period Ts ≡ 1/Fs, so is hN (t). We consider the behavior of hN (t) on the interval [−Ts/2, Ts/2). Because of the periodicity of hN (t), the behavior of hN (t) on all other such intervals must be essentially the same.
Assuming that for small t we know that |r(t)| < K1/|t| and |rt(t)| < K2/|t 2— as is the case for g(t)/ sin(πFst)—we find that as N → ∞,
g(t) = g(0) + gt(0)t + gtt(0)t2/2 + gttt(0)t3/6 + g(4)(ξ)ξ4/24 for some ξ between 0 and t [17]. This allows us to conclude that
× g(0) + gt(0)t + gtt(0)t2/2 + gttt(0)t3/6 + g(4)(ξ)ξ4/24 dt.
The ideal sampler takes a function, g(t), and multiplies it by another “function,” Δ(t). 
Considering Figure 1.2, it is clear that in order to prevent overlap, we must require that F < Fs − F . That is, we must require that
and one half the sampling rate is known as the Nyquist frequency2.
Consider, for example, the function g(t) = sin[2πF t]. Let us take 2F samples per second at the times t = k/(2F ). We find that the samples of the signal are g[k/(2F )] = sin(πk) = 0. 
2 The sampling theorem was published by H. Nyquist in 1928, and was proved by
C.E. Shannon in 1949. See [18] for more information about the history of the Nyquist sampling theorem.
For relatively small values of f we find that e−πjf Ts and sin(πf /Fs)/(πf/Fs) are both near 1. When f is small we see that
Vout(f ) ≈ Vin(f ), |f| << Fs.

Understanding Sampling

test case [FORMULA]
Summary. In Part I, we consider the analysis of discrete time signals. In Chapter [NUMERIC], we consider how discretizing a signal affects the signals Fourier transform. We derive the Nyquist sampling theorem, and we give conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a continuous time signal from its samples.

[NUMERIC] The Sample and hold Operation
Given a function [FORMULA], if one samples the function when [FORMULA] and one holds the sampled value until the next sample comes, then the result of the sampling procedure is the function [FORMULA] defined by
[FORMULA].
It is easy enough to calculate the Fourier transform of [FORMULA] frequency response of the [FORMULA] is simply
[FORMULA] Exercise [NUMERIC])
let us consider [FORMULA] to be a periodic function. Then its Fourier series is [FORMULA]
Rewriting [FORMULA] and making use of the properties of the geometric series, we find that for [FORMULA],
[FORMULA]
[FORMULA]
When [FORMULA], it is easy to see that [FORMULA]. 
Because [FORMULA] is a combination of functions that are periodic with period [FORMULA], so is [FORMULA]. We consider the behavior of [FORMULA] on the interval [FORMULA]. Because of the periodicity of [FORMULA], the behavior of [FORMULA] on all other such intervals must be essentially the same.
Assuming that for small [FORMULA] we know that [FORMULA] and [FORMULA]as is the case for [FORMULA] find that as [FORMULA]  ,
[FORMULA] for some  between [NUMERIC] and [FORMULA]. This allows us to conclude that
