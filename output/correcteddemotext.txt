Summary. In Part I, we consider the analysis of discrete-time signals. In Chapter [NUMERIC], we consider how discretizing a signal affects the signal’s Fourier transform. We derive the Nyquist sampling theorem, and we give conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a continuous-time signal from its samples.

[NUMERIC] The Sample-and-hold Operation [FORMULA]
Given a function [FORMULA], if one samples the function when [FORMULA] and one holds the sampled value until the next sample comes, then the result of the sampling procedure is the function [FORMULA] defined by
[FORMULA].
It is easy enough to calculate the Fourier transform of [FORMULA]the frequency response of the filter—it is simply
(See Exercise [NUMERIC])
let us consider [FORMULA] to be a periodic function. Then its Fourier series is [FORMULA]
Rewriting [FORMULA] and making use of the properties of the geometric series, we find that for [FORMULA],
[FORMULA]
[FORMULA]
When [FORMULA], it is easy to see that [FORMULA]. 
Because [FORMULA] is a combination of functions that are periodic with period [FORMULA], so is [FORMULA]. We consider the behavior of [FORMULA] on the interval [FORMULA]. Because of the periodicity of [FORMULA], the behavior of [FORMULA] on all other such intervals must be essentially the same.
Assuming that for small [FORMULA] we know that [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] as is the case for [FORMULA]we find that as [FORMULA],
[FORMULA] for some  between [FORMULA] and [FORMULA]. This allows us to conclude that
[FORMULA].
The ideal sampler takes a function, [FORMULA], and multiplies it by another “function,” [FORMULA]. 
Considering Figure [NUMERIC], it is clear that in order to prevent overlap, we must require that [FORMULA] . That is, we must require that
and one half the sampling rate is known as the Nyquist frequency2.
Consider, for example, the function [FORMULA]. Let us take [FORMULA] samples per second at the times [FORMULA]. We find that the samples of the signal are [FORMULA]. 
[FORMULA] The sampling theorem was published by H. Nyquist in 1928, and was proved by
C.E. Shannon in 1949. See [FORMULA] for more information about the history of the Nyquist sampling theorem.
For relatively small values of f we find that [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] are both near [FORMULA]. When [FORMUAL] is small we see that
[FORMULA], [FORMULA].
[NUMERIC]. Suppose [FORMULA] and one uses a sample-and-hold element that samples at the times
Using Fourier transforms, calculate what the sampled-and-held waveform will be.
[NUMERIC]. Show that [FORMULA]the frequency response of the “hold element”—can be written as
[NUMERIC]. Show that the spectrum of an ideally sampled signal as given in [FORMULA] is periodic in [FORMUAL] and has period [FORMUAL].

[NUMERIC]. Construct a SimulinkOr
model that samples a signal 100 times per second and outputs the samples to an oscilloscope. Input a sinewave of frequency [FORMULA] Hz and one of frequency [FORMULA] Hz. You may use the “zero-order hold” block to perform the sample-and-hold operation.
