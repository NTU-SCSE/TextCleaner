Understanding Sampling
Summary. In Part I, we consider the analysis of discrete time signals. In Chapter [FORMULA] we consider how [FORMULA] a signal affects the signals Fourier transform. We derive the [FORMULA] sampling theorem, and we give conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a continuous time signal from its samples.
Keywords. sample and hold.
[FORMULA] The Sample and hold Operation
Given a function [FORMULA] if one samples the function when t [FORMULA]and one holds the sampled value until the next sample comes, then the result of the sampling procedure is the function [FORMULA] defined by
Y [FORMULA] [FORMULA]
It is easy enough to calculate the Fourier transform of [FORMULA] frequency response of the [FORMULA] is simply
(See Exercise [FORMULA]
let us consider [FORMULA] to be a periodic function. Then its Fourier series is [FORMULA]
Rewriting [FORMULA] and making use of the properties of the geometric series, we find that for t [FORMULA]

When t [FORMULA]it is easy to see that [FORMULA]
Because [FORMULA]is a combination of functions that are periodic with period [FORMULA]  [FORMULA] so is [FORMULA]We consider the behavior of [FORMULA]on the interval [FORMULA]Because of the periodicity of [FORMULA]the behavior of [FORMULA]on all other such intervals must be essentially the same.
Assuming that for small t we know that [FORMULA]and [FORMULA]as is the case for [FORMULA]find that as N  ,

The ideal sampler takes a function, [FORMULA] and multiplies it by another function, [FORMULA] 
Considering Figure [FORMULA] it is clear that in order to prevent overlap, we must require that F [FORMULA] Fs  F . That is, we must require that
and one half the sampling rate is known as the [FORMULA]
Consider, for example, the function [FORMULA]Let us take [FORMULA] samples per second at the times t [FORMULA]We find that the samples of the signal are [FORMULA]

For relatively small values of f we find that [FORMULA]and [FORMULA]are both near [FORMULA] When f is small we see that

Using Fourier transforms, calculate what the sampled and held waveform will be.

[FORMULA] Construct a [FORMULA]
model that samples a signal [FORMULA] times per sec 
[FORMULA] and outputs the samples to an oscilloscope. Input a [FORMULA] of frequency [FORMULA]and one of frequency [FORMULA]You may use the zero order hold block to perform the sample and hold operation.
