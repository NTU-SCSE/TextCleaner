test case [FORMULA]
Summary. In Part I, we consider the analysis of [FORMULA] signals. In Chapter [NUMERIC], we consider how discretizing a signal affects the signals Fourier transform. We derive the Nyquist sampling theorem, and we give conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a [FORMULA] signal from its samples.

[NUMERIC] The [FORMULA] Operation [FORMULA]
Given a function [FORMULA], if one samples the function when [FORMULA] and one holds the sampled value until the next sample comes, then the result of the sampling procedure is the function [FORMULA] defined by
[FORMULA]( [FORMULA])[FORMULA].
It is easy enough to calculate the Fourier transform of [FORMULA] the frequency response of the [FORMULA] is simply
( See Exercise [NUMERIC].)
let us consider[FORMULA] to be a periodic function. Then its Fourier series is[ [NUMERIC]]
Rewriting( [NUMERIC].[BULLET] and making use of the properties of the geometric series, we find that for [FORMULA],
[FORMULA]\ [FORMULA]
[FORMULA]
When [FORMULA], it is easy to see that [FORMULA].
Because [FORMULA] is a combination of functions that are periodic with period [FORMULA], so is [FORMULA]. We consider the behavior of [FORMULA] on the interval[ [FORMULA][BULLET]. Because of the periodicity of [FORMULA], the behavior of [FORMULA] on all other such intervals must be essentially the same.
Assuming that for small [FORMULA] we know that [FORMULA] and [FORMULA]as is the case for [FORMULA] sin[FORMULA] we find that as [FORMULA],
[FORMULA]() [FORMULA] for some between [NUMERIC] and [FORMULA][ [NUMERIC]]. This allows us to conclude that
[FORMULA]() [FORMULA].
The ideal sampler takes a function, [FORMULA], and multiplies it by another function,[FORMULA].
Considering Figure [NUMERIC], it is clear that in order to prevent overlap, we must require that [FORMULA]. That is, we must require that
and one half the sampling rate is known as the Nyquist [FORMULA].
Consider, for example, the function [FORMULA] sin[ [FORMULA]]. Let us take [FORMULA] samples per second at the times [FORMULA]. We find that the samples of the signal are [FORMULA][ [FORMULA]] [FORMULA] sin[FORMULA].
[NUMERIC] The sampling theorem was published by [FORMULA] Nyquist in [NUMERIC], and was proved by
[FORMULA]. [FORMULA] in [NUMERIC]. See[ [NUMERIC]] for more information about the history of the Nyquist sampling theorem.
For relatively small values of [FORMULA] we find that [FORMULA] and sin( [FORMULA][BULLET] [FORMULA]( [FORMULA][BULLET] are both near [NUMERIC]. When [FORMULA] is small we see that
[FORMULA] Vin[FORMULA].

Using Fourier transforms, calculate what the [FORMULA] waveform will be.
