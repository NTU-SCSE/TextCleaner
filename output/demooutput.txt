Summary. In Part I, we consider the analysis of discrete time signals. In Chapter [NUMERIC], we consider how discretizing a signal affects the signals Fourier transform. We derive the Nyquist sampling theorem, and we give conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a continuous time signal from its samples.

[NUMERIC] The Sample and hold Operation
Given a function [FORMULA], if one samples the function when [FORMULA] and one holds the sampled value until the next sample comes, then the result of the sampling procedure is the function [FORMULA] defined by
[FORMULA]
It is easy enough to calculate the Fourier transform of [FORMULA] frequency response of the [FORMULA] is simply
[FORMULA] Exercise [NUMERIC])
let us consider
Rewriting [FORMULA]) and making use of the properties of the geometric series, we find that for [FORMULA],

[NUMERIC]  [FORMULA]
When [FORMULA], it is easy to see that [FORMULA]
Because [FORMULA]
Assuming that for small [FORMULA] we know that [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] [NUMERIC] as is the case for [FORMULA] find that as [FORMULA]  ,
[FORMULA] for some  between [NUMERIC] and [FORMULA]. This allows us to conclude that
 [FORMULA].
The ideal sampler takes a function, [FORMULA], and multiplies it by another function, [FORMULA]. 
Considering Figure [NUMERIC], it is clear that in order to prevent overlap, we must require that [FORMULA] Fs  [FORMULA] . That is, we must require that
and one half the sampling rate is known as the Nyquist [FORMULA].
Consider, for example, the function [FORMULA]. Let us take [FORMULA] samples per second at the times [FORMULA]. We find that the samples of the signal are [FORMULA] [NUMERIC]. 
[NUMERIC] The sampling theorem was published by [FORMULA]. Nyquist in [NUMERIC], and was proved by
[FORMULA]. [FORMULA] in [NUMERIC]. See [FORMULA] for more information about the history of the Nyquist sampling theorem.
For relatively small values of [FORMULA] we find that [FORMULA] and [FORMULA]) are both near [NUMERIC]. When [FORMULA] is small we see that
[FORMULA] Fs.

Using Fourier transforms, calculate what the sampled and held waveform will be.
