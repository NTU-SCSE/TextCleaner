Understanding Sampling
Summary. In Part I, we consider the analysis of discrete time signals. In Chapter [FORMULA], we consider how discretizing a signal affects the signals Fourier transform. We derive the Nyquist sampling theorem, and we give conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a continuous time signal from its samples.
Keywords. sample and hold.
[FORMULA] The Sample and hold Operation
Given a function [FORMULA], if one samples the function when [FORMULA] and one holds the sampled value until the next sample comes, then the result of the sampling procedure is the function [FORMULA] defined by
[FORMULA].
It is easy enough to calculate the Fourier transform of [FORMULA] frequency response of the filterit is simply
(See Exercise [FORMULA]
let us consider [FORMULA] to be a periodic function. Then its Fourier series is [FORMULA]
Rewriting [FORMULA] and making use of the properties of the geometric series, we find that for [FORMULA],
[FORMULA]
[FORMULA]
When [FORMULA], it is easy to see that [FORMULA]. 
Because [FORMULA] is a combination of functions that are periodic with period [FORMULA], so is [FORMULA]. We consider the behavior of [FORMULA] on the interval [FORMULA]. Because of the periodicity of [FORMULA], the behavior of [FORMULA] on all other such intervals must be essentially the same.
Assuming that for small [FORMULA] we know that [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] as is the case for [FORMULA] find that as [FORMULA]  ,
[FORMULA] for some  between [FORMULA] and [FORMULA]. This allows us to conclude that
 [FORMULA].
The ideal sampler takes a function, [FORMULA], and multiplies it by another function, [FORMULA]. 
Considering Figure [FORMULA], it is clear that in order to prevent overlap, we must require that [FORMULA] Fs  [FORMULA] . That is, we must require that
and one half the sampling rate is known as the Nyquist [FORMULA].
Consider, for example, the function [FORMULA]. Let us take [FORMULA] samples per second at the times [FORMULA]. We find that the samples of the signal are [FORMULA]. 
[FORMULA] The sampling theorem was published by [FORMULA]. Nyquist in [FORMULA], and was proved by
[FORMULA]. [FORMULA] in [FORMULA]. See [FORMULA] for more information about the history of the Nyquist sampling theorem.
For relatively small values of [FORMULA] we find that [FORMULA] and [FORMULA] are both near [FORMULA]. When [FORMULA] is small we see that
[FORMULA] Fs.
[FORMULA]. Suppose [FORMULA] and one uses a sample and hold element that samples at the times
Using Fourier transforms, calculate what the sampled and held waveform will be.
[FORMULA]. Show that [FORMULA] frequency response of the hold elementcan be written as
[FORMULA]. Show that the spectrum of an ideally sampled signal as given in [FORMULA] is periodic in [FORMULA] and has period Fs.

[FORMULA] Continuous on the whole real line.
[FORMULA] Understanding Sampling
[FORMULA]. Construct a [FORMULA]
model that samples a signal [FORMULA] times per second and outputs the samples to an oscilloscope. Input a sinewave of frequency [FORMULA] and one of frequency [FORMULA]. You may use the zero order hold block to perform the sample and hold operation.
