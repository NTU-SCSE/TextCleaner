Summary. In Part I, we consider the analysis of discrete-time signals. In Chapter 1, we consider how discretizing a signal affects the signal’s Fourier transform. We derive the Nyquist sampling theorem, and we give conditions under which it is possible to reconstruct a continuous-time signal from its samples.

1.1 The Sample-and-hold Operation
Given a function g(t), if one samples the function when t = nTs and one holds the sampled value until the next sample comes, then the result of the sampling procedure is the function g˜(t) defined by
Y (f ) = F(y(t))(f ) ≡ e−2πjfty(t) dt.
It is easy enough to calculate the Fourier transform of h(t)—the frequency response of the filter—it is simply
(See Exercise 2.)
let us consider Δ(t) to be a periodic function. Then its Fourier series is [7]
Rewriting (1.1) and making use of the properties of the geometric series, we find that for t /= m/Fs,
= e−2πjN t \ e2πjnFst
1 − e2πjFst
When t = m/Fs, it is easy to see that hN (t) = 2N + 1. 
Because hN (t) is a combination of functions that are periodic with period Ts ≡ 1/Fs, so is hN (t). We consider the behavior of hN (t) on the interval [−Ts/2, Ts/2). Because of the periodicity of hN (t), the behavior of hN (t) on all other such intervals must be essentially the same.
Assuming that for small t we know that |r(t)| < K1/|t| and |rt(t)| < K2/|t 2— as is the case for g(t)/ sin(πFst)—we find that as N → ∞,
g(t) = g(0) + gt(0)t + gtt(0)t2/2 + gttt(0)t3/6 + g(4)(ξ)ξ4/24 for some ξ between 0 and t [17]. This allows us to conclude that
× g(0) + gt(0)t + gtt(0)t2/2 + gttt(0)t3/6 + g(4)(ξ)ξ4/24 dt.
The ideal sampler takes a function, g(t), and multiplies it by another “function,” Δ(t). 
Considering Figure 1.2, it is clear that in order to prevent overlap, we must require that F < Fs − F . That is, we must require that
and one half the sampling rate is known as the Nyquist frequency2.
Consider, for example, the function g(t) = sin[2πF t]. Let us take 2F samples per second at the times t = k/(2F ). We find that the samples of the signal are g[k/(2F )] = sin(πk) = 0. 
2 The sampling theorem was published by H. Nyquist in 1928, and was proved by
C.E. Shannon in 1949. See [18] for more information about the history of the Nyquist sampling theorem.
For relatively small values of f we find that e−πjf Ts and sin(πf /Fs)/(πf/Fs) are both near 1. When f is small we see that
Vout(f ) ≈ Vin(f ), |f| << Fs.
1. Suppose g(t) = sin(2πFst) and one uses a sample-and-hold element that samples at the times
Using Fourier transforms, calculate what the sampled-and-held waveform will be.
3. Show that H(f )—the frequency response of the “hold element”—can be written as
5. Show that the spectrum of an ideally sampled signal as given in (1.2) is periodic in f and has period Fs.
6. Show that the function
a) Periodic with period 1.
b) Continuous on the whole real line.

7. Construct a SimulinkOr
model that samples a signal 100 times per sec-
ond and outputs the samples to an oscilloscope. Input a sinewave of frequency 5 Hz and one of frequency 49 Hz. You may use the “zero-order hold” block to perform the sample-and-hold operation.
